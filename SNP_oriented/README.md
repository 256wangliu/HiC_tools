## SNP-oriented Hi-C analysis

- `iRegNet3D` - Integrated Regulatory Network 3D (iRegNet3D) is a high-resolution regulatory network comprised of interfaces of all known transcription factor (TF)-TF, TF-DNA interaction interfaces, as well as chromatin-chromatin interactions and topologically associating domain (TAD) information from different cell lines.  
    - Goal: SNP interpretation
    - Input: One or several SNPs, rsIDs or genomic coordinates.
    - Output: For one or two SNPs, on-screen information of their disease-related info, connection over TF-TF and chromatin interaction networks, and whether they interact in 3D and located within TADs. For multiple SNPs, same info downloadable as text files.
