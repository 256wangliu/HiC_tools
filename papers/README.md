Technical aspects of 3C technologies, alignment. Existing pipelines (Hicpipe, hiclib, Hi-Five recimmended). Methods for simulating Hi-C data. Some methods are implemented in GOTHiC R package. Capture Hi-C technology for targeted 3C capturing. Real-life experiments, analysis, detection of significant interactions, enrichment in epigenetic marks, association of chromatin interactions with gene expression, GWAS SNP enrichment in the promoters of genes. Future of 3C technologies.
