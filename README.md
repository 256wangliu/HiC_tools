# A collection of tools and papers related to Hi-C data analysis

Slowly growing as notes from my Zotero collection are getting organized.

Each folder has its own README file with task-specific tools.

A related repository holds references to Hi-C data, https://github.com/mdozmorov/HiC_data

Issues and/or Pull requests to add other data are welcome!
