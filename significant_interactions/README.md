Bailey, and William Stafford Noble. “Statistical Confidence Estimation for Hi-C Data Reveals Regulatory Chromatin Contacts.” Genome Research 24, no. 6 (June 2014): 999–1011. https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.160374.113. - Fit-Hi-C method, Splines to model distance dependence. Model mid-range interaction frequencies, decay with distance. Biases, methods for normalization. Two-step splines - use all dots for first fit, identify and remove outliers, second fit without outliers. Markers of boundaries - insulators, heterochromatin, pluripotent factors. CNVs are enriched in chromatin boundaries. Replication timing data how-to http://www.replicationdomain.com/. Validation Hi-C data. http://chromosome.sdsc.edu/mouse/hi-c/download.html
